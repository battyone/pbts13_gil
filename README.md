This repository contains simple GIL benchmarks used in my article [Python behind the scenes #13: the GIL and its effects on Python multithreading](https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-13-the-gil-and-its-effects-on-python-multithreading/).

Better GIL benchmarks can be found in the CPython repository. See https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Tools/ccbench/ccbench.py.
